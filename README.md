# hello-world
This is for practice, not for real. It's my very first repository on GitHub by the way.
Hi, my name is Marcus Webb. I am a passionate, self-taught, up-and-coming Front-End Web Developer who absolutely loves to code, and aspires to work with a team of talented Developers who can both guide me through the waters as I journey into my exciting career, and trust in my ability to learn quickly and code efficiently.
